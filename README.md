# ATM Project - Java Programming

This repository contains a Java-based ATM simulation project developed by Vinamra Vaswani (HU21CSEN0101331). The project consists of two main classes: `ATMInterface` and `Account`, which together simulate an ATM environment that provides various banking services based on user requests.

## Project Overview

- **ATM Interface**: Simulates the ATM's environment and provides services like withdrawals, balance checks, transaction history, deposits, and PIN changes.
- **Account**: Manages account details and works in sync with the ATM's authorization mechanism.

## Features

- **Account Management**: Create accounts with unique account numbers and PINs.
- **Authentication**: Secure PIN-based authentication for account access.
- **Withdrawal**: Withdraw funds from an account, ensuring sufficient balance.
- **Balance Check**: Display the current account balance.
- **Transaction History**: Record and display transaction history.
- **Deposit**: Deposit funds into an account.
- **PIN Change**: Change the account PIN securely.

## Default Credentials

For ease of testing, a default account is provided:

- **Account Number**: 1331
- **PIN**: 2077

## Classes and Methods

### ATMInterface Class

- **ATMInterface(ArrayList<Account> AccountsList)**: Constructor to initialize the ATM with a list of accounts.
- **void printMenu()**: Displays the main menu and initiates the ATM operations.
- **private void proceed()**: Handles user choices and directs to corresponding services.
- **private void withdraw()**: Manages withdrawal operations.
- **private void deposit()**: Manages deposit operations.
- **private void changePin()**: Allows the user to change their PIN.
- **private void checkBalance()**: Displays the current account balance.
- **private void printHistory()**: Prints the transaction history.
- **private boolean getChoice()**: Asks the user whether to return to the menu or exit.
- **private Account getAccount(int num)**: Checks if an account exists based on the account number.
- **private boolean checkPin()**: Verifies the account PIN with up to 3 attempts.

### Account Class

- **Account()**: Default constructor with preset account details (1331, 2077).
- **Account(int AccNum, int accPin)**: Parameterized constructor to create custom accounts.
- **private void getDetails()**: Collects and sets user details for the account.

### Main Class

- **public static void main(String[] args)**: Initializes accounts and starts the ATM interface.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atm-project.git
    cd atm-project
    ```

2. **Compile the Code**:
    ```sh
    javac Main.java
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```sh
    java Main
    ```

4. **Use Default Credentials for Testing**:
    - Account Number: 1331
    - PIN: 2077
